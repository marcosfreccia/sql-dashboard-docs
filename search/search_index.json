In this getting started document, I hope to cover the things that you need to do. Installing Python The very first thing to do in the server where you plan to run SQL Dashboard is install Python 3.6. To do this, go to the Python.org page and click on downloads page. The web page detects the operating system of your server or laptop and will let you download the right Python installation for your OS, but you can still download to other Operating Systems as well. SQL Dashborad runs on Windows Server, so I just go and download Python for Windows. After the downloaded has completed, proceed to install Python in your environment. Clonning the project Decide where in the file system you wish to place SQL Dashboard and clone the project by executing the code below in the command prompt. git clone https://github.com/marcosfreccia/SQLDashboard.git If you don\u2019t have in your laptop or server the github cli, you can just download the zip file. Creating the virtual environment Virtual Environments helps you to isolate your Python applications. When you have multiple Python projects running in the same server, the virtual environment helps to keep everything isolated and also helps when certain projects has package version dependencies. I\u2019ve written the below blog post to explain how to create a new virtual environment. https://marcosfreccia.com/2017/12/21/python-virtual-environments-be-safe/ Enabling Social Authentication Django supports several authentication back-ends. At this moment, SQL Dashboard is enabled to use the following authentication back-ends: Github and Google. If you want to use any of those methods, please follow the below article to setup for your environment. https://fosstack.com/how-to-add-google-authentication-in-django/ Creating the settings.cfg In the settings.cfg we store environment variables such as: database hosts and credentials, django secret keys, etc..
